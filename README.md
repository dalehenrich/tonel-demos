# Tonel integration with VA Smalltalk demos

Repository used for sharing some demos about Tonel integration with VASmalltalk.

In `source` directory you can find some tonel files that were generated from VA Smalltalk apps. 
`TonelExampleForPharoApp` doesn't have any VA subapps and its expectd to be imported in Pharo using Iceberg without issues. 
`TonelExampleFor` has subapps, config expressions, prerequisites, shadow subapps, private methods, multi categorized methods,
and all different VA specific features. This app is intended to be imported only in VA Smalltalk, yet not loosing any if the information
that was originally in the VA applications.
